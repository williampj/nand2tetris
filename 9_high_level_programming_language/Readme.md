# High Level Programming Language

## The Jack Language

- Chapter 9 covered the Jack language, a Java-like language that will be used
  in the remainder of the course to write the compiler (that compiles programs from
  Jack to VM code) and the operating system.
- To get acquainted with the language, the project for the chapter was to build
  a classic computer game.

## Worm

- The `WormGame` built for this project is a game of a worm that continuously grows until it either
  hits its own body or moves out of bounds. The game speed is fairly high,
  thus the goal is to cover as many squares as possible
- To run the game, load the the `worm` folder in chapter 9 into the accompanying VM emulator
